# Microcontrollers_PIC_-_16F886
Some aplications, and something about my electronic engineer background, you can simulate all this circuits with ISIS proteus. They where programmed by the IDE PIC C compiler and uploaded to microcontroller through PICkit 3 softwares.
Each file contains a simulation on Protheus and a .hex file witch can be program a PIC microcontroller
